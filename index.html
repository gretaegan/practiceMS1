    <h3>100% would recommend to anybody!</h3>
    <p>I recently completed an integrated training course at Wings and within 3 months was offered my dream job on the Boeing737-800! I would recommend this school to everyone
    who wants to become an airline pilot, the training is second to none! <i>- Greta Egan, Ryanair</i><p>

    <h3>I went from zero to hero in less than 2 years!</h3>
    <p>I have just finished training at Wings and will be starting my type rating on the Airbus A320 soon. I went from having no flying experience to being airline ready
    in less than two years! Without Wings this wouldnt have been possible. <i>- Abdelaziz Salem, Aer Lingus</i><p>

       <h3> World class training!</h3>
       <p> I never thought that when I graduated from Wings all of those years ago that I would end up flying the Queen of the Skies in Hong Kong. Having done my
       training at Wings definitely was an advantage when interviewing for my dream job on the Boeing 747. The school is internationally respected, training with 
       Wings is a no brainer. <i>-Cormac Meyler, Cathay Pacific</i></p>
